# Socialmoodia

## Description

Socialmoodia is a social media website that allows users to make posts and comments, but can only use emoji's to do so. Like any other social media website, a user can sign up, log in and see a feed of posts. A user can also see other users posts by going to their profile by either searching for it or clicking on a user's profile picture from their feed. In future development a follow feature is also planned so that a user will eventually only see posts from people they follow.
